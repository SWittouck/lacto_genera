# Lactobacillus genus taxonomy

This repository contains code to analyze the genus-level (and family-level) taxonomy of the Lactobacillus Genus Complex (families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae). The input for these analyses is generated by the [legen pipeline](https://github.com/SWittouck/legen_pipeline), particularly by the scripts in the folder 04_analyze_representatives.

The repository is currently empty because I am finalizing the code - it will be pushed to GitHub soon.

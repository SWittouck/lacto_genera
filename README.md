# Lactobacillus genus taxonomy

This repository contains code to analyze the genus-level (and family-level) taxonomy of the Lactobacillus Genus Complex (families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae). The input for these analyses is generated by the [legen pipeline](https://github.com/SWittouck/legen_pipeline), particularly by the scripts in the folder 04_analyze_representatives. The folder input includes the necessary data files so that it is not required to run the legen pipeline yourself in order to repeat and/or play around with the data analysis.

Data files:

* legen_v3_3_repr*.rda: R data files from the legen pipeline, containing pangenomes and genome metadata
